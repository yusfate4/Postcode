# Postcode
This is a basic task to test your ability to adapt to various design types and still implement a perfect representation of the design including responsiveness.

There are no right or wrong way to do this task, however the following applies:
 

1. You cannot use Table tags
2. You cannot use frameworks, libraries or ready-made components
3. You cannot copy the code from the page directly

Your Task

1. Recreate this page: https://checkmypostcode.uk/ 
2. Do not create any internal links, just the main page
3. Change the main title from "Check My Postcode" to "Check My Student ID" (You can get your student ID from your dashboard)
4. Replace every mention of Postcode or postcode on the page with your Student ID
5. The form does not have to submit, this is purely HTML/CSS/JS task.
